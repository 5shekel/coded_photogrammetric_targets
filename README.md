Coded Photogrammetric Targets
=============================

Circular coded targets are frequently used in close-range photogrammetry, as these targets can be recognised fully automatically. Based on the code written by [Matthew Petroff](https://mpetroff.net/2018/05/photogrammetry-targets/), 
a corresponding implementation was created in [Matlab](https://mathworks.com/). The script generates the ring codes of the targets using, e.g., the 14-bit code as described in the expired German 
patent [DE19733466A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE19733466A1/).
